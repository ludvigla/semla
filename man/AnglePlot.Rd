\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{Seurat}}

\item{column_name}{A character specifying a meta data column holding the categorical
feature vector.}

\item{selected_group}{A label defining a group of spots found in a column of
the meta data slot specified by \code{column_name}}

\item{radius}{A numeric value between 0.1 and 1 specifying the size of the
"angle plot" overlaid on the spatial plot.}

\item{nbreaks}{Number of intervals to cut the angles into}

\item{centroid_size}{Size of the centroid spot}

\item{image_use}{A character specifying image type to use.}

\item{coords_use}{A character specifying coordinate type to use.}

\item{crop_area}{A numeric vector of length 4 specifying a rectangular area to crop
the plots by. These numbers should be within 0-1. The x-axis is goes from left=0 to
right=1 and the y axis is goes from top=0 to bottom=1. The order of the values are
specified as follows: \code{crop_area = c(left, top, right, bottom)}. The crop area
will be used on all tissue sections and cannot be set for each section individually.
using crop areas of different sizes on different sections can lead to unwanted side
effects as the point sizes will remain constant. In this case it is better to generate
separate plots for different tissue sections.}

\item{pt_size}{A numeric value specifying the point size passed to \code{geom_point}}

\item{pt_alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the point opacity passed
to \code{geom_point}. A value of 0 will make the points completely transparent
and a value of 1 will make the points completely opaque.}

\item{pt_stroke}{A numeric specifying the point stroke width}

\item{section_number}{An integer select a tissue section number to subset data by}

\item{label_by}{A character specifying a column name in \code{object} with
labels that can be used to provide a title for each subplot. This column should have
1 label per tissue section. This can be useful when you need to provide more detailed
information about your tissue sections.}

\item{ncol}{An integer value specifying the number of columns in the output patchwork.}

\item{colors}{A character vector of colors to use for the color scale. The number of
colors should match the number of labels present.}

\item{override_plot_dims}{A logical specifying whether the image dimensions should
be used to define the plot area. Setting \code{override_plot_dims} can be useful
in situations where the tissue section only covers a small fraction of the capture
area, which will create a lot of white space in the plots. The same effect can be
achieved with the \code{crop_area} but the crop area is instead determined directly
from the data.}

\item{drop_na}{A logical specifying if NA values should be dropped}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to other methods}

\description{
Draws on angle plot on top of a selected region. The plot is meant to help
defining angle intervals for computing radial distances with \code{\link{RadialDistance}}.
}
\details{
The region of interest is selected with \code{selected_group} and has to be a group
of a categorical variable selected with \code{column_name} which is stored in the
meta data of the input Seurat object. The selected region has to be spatially connected.
